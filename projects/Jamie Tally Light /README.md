# Tally Light

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
The board I am making is a tally light for a multi-camera livestream system. Each tally light will connect to a laptop running Tally-Arbiter. This latpop will act as the server. It also connects to the video switcher, like a Blackmagic ATEM. 
A tally light allows for the camera operator to know if their camera is live. If their camera is live the light will be red, and if their camera is next up it will be green. The Tally light also has a OLED display to send messages to the camera operator from the livestream's director.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It does not require many parts, only an ESP32 for WIFI communication and some Neopixel LEDS. The OLED display will be provided by myself so that I can get the right model.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
